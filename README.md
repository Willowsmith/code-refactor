# code-refactor

## Refactoring a website so that it follows accessability standards and is cleaner.

-My motivation was to keep the functionality and look of the website while making cleaner and more readable code that followed accessability standards.
-I built this project so that the website would be more accessable and that my CSS knowledge would improve.
-The problem that I solved is that the website is now capable of being found more easily on search engines and more functional for all users. It also solved the problem of messy CSS code.
-I learned that you can consolidate several sections of CSS which greatly reduces repetition but keeps functionality.
